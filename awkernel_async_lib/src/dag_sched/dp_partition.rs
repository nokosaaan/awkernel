//! System-wide Deadline-Partition boundary tracking and real dispatch
//! entitlement (real-machine DAG-Fluid): every DAG-Fluid task's own
//! per-segment absolute deadline (computed at admission time — see
//! `rd_gen_to_dags::dag_fluid`'s own module doc for Algorithm 1 lines
//! 16–21, the 2022 paper's Section 8 thread-list conversion) is
//! registered here once, before dispatch begins. Two independent
//! consumers then watch [`PENDING`]:
//!
//! - [`on_dp_boundary`] (a `TimerRequestId::DpBoundary` interrupt
//!   callback): fires exactly at each boundary's theoretical deadline and
//!   logs the measurement this module is named for (scheduled vs. actual
//!   time) — nothing else. It never mutates a segment's completion state
//!   and never touches [`CURRENT`] or the DAG/task graph (see "Split
//!   design" below for why).
//! - [`advance_due_segments`] (an ordinary background task, spawned by
//!   [`spawn_advancer`]): polls [`PENDING`] on a short, fixed cadence
//!   ([`ADVANCER_POLL_INTERVAL`]) and, once a due boundary's own
//!   *completion gate* is satisfied (see below), advances that DAG's
//!   current segment and calls `scheduler::dp_wrap::recompute_and_apply`
//!   to recompute the real per-CPU entitlement for the new Deadline
//!   Partition.
//!
//! # Completion gate: advance is gated on real work, not just the clock
//! The papers' segment deadlines are assigned with *zero* slack by
//! construction (`Σd_i,j` sums exactly to the virtual deadline `D*_i` —
//! see `rd_gen_to_dags::dag_fluid`'s own module doc): the idealized fluid
//! model proves a segment finishes exactly on time if run at its own
//! `theta_i,j` rate continuously, with no margin anywhere. On real
//! hardware, IPI latency, migration cost, and discrete task-switch
//! granularity all eat directly into that zero margin.
//!
//! An earlier design would have advanced strictly on the theoretical
//! clock, reassigning a CPU's entitlement to the *next* segment the
//! instant a boundary's scheduled time passed, regardless of whether the
//! current segment's own work had actually finished — silently abandoning
//! any still-running node with no rescue mechanism. This was explicitly
//! rejected as unacceptable. Instead, each [`BoundaryEntry`] carries a
//! `gate_nodes` list ([`rd_gen_to_dags::dag_fluid::segment_completion_gates`]'s
//! own output — the node ids the idealized timeline expects to finish
//! exactly at this segment's end): [`advance_due_segments`] only actually
//! advances past a boundary once every node in its gate has really
//! processed at least one period (see [`gate_satisfied_from_cache`]'s own
//! doc for why `DagInfo::period_index`, not `TaskInfo`'s own `State`, is
//! the right signal for this). Until then, the CPU(s) currently
//! entitled to that DAG keep their entitlement (the segment does **not**
//! lose its capacity share), the overrun is logged once, and the boundary
//! is retried on the advancer's own next poll — the gap between
//! "theoretical deadline" and "gate actually satisfied" *is* the
//! theory-vs-reality measurement this module exists to produce, made
//! visible in the log rather than silently absorbed.
//!
//! # Split design: why the gate check cannot run from the timer callback
//! An earlier version ran the completion-gate check (and the subsequent
//! `CURRENT` update / entitlement recompute) directly inside
//! [`on_dp_boundary`]. This reproducibly broke the system: **every**
//! `TimerRequestId::DpBoundary` firing after the first simply stopped
//! happening at all, confirmed with both a blocking `Mutex::lock` and a
//! non-blocking `Mutex::try_lock` for the gate check's own node lookups.
//! Direct experiment isolated this to calling into `Dag`'s graph lock or
//! `TaskInfo`'s own lock from timer-interrupt context specifically: with
//! an empty `gate_nodes` (skipping both), all three of a real test DAG's
//! segments fired correctly with the *same* surrounding code; with a
//! real, non-empty gate, only the first ever fired. The likely mechanism
//! (not fully confirmed): `awkernel_sync`'s `InterruptGuard` (used
//! internally by every `MCSLock::lock`/`try_lock`) calls
//! `voluntary_preemption()` on drop whenever interrupts end up enabled
//! again — appropriate for ordinary task-context code, but not
//! necessarily safe to trigger from inside a timer ISR's own callback
//! chain. `Dag::graph`/`TaskInfo`'s locks are also the *same* locks
//! ordinary task-context code (pub/sub routing, `task::run_main`'s own
//! poll bookkeeping) contends for concurrently — unlike this module's own
//! `PENDING`/`CURRENT` locks, which only this module ever touches and
//! which showed no such issue either from the timer callback or from the
//! advancer task.
//!
//! The fix is this module's current split: [`on_dp_boundary`] touches
//! only [`PENDING`] (proven safe from interrupt context) purely to timestamp
//! *when* each boundary's theoretical deadline was actually observed;
//! every DAG/task lookup (`resolve_gate_period_indices`) and every `CURRENT`/
//! entitlement mutation happens only from [`advance_due_segments`],
//! which never runs from interrupt context.
//!
//! # Scope: not WCET-proven dispatch
//! By explicit user direction, this module does not carry a proven WCET
//! bound on its own callback latency — that latency (and now also gate
//! overrun) is exactly what it measures, not what it guarantees.
//!
//! # Placement: whichever CPU happens to register/arm it
//! `awkernel_lib::timer::request_at` arms whichever CPU calls it (that
//! module's own per-CPU multiplexer design); this module does not enforce
//! any particular placement, only logs which CPU actually did the
//! arming/firing.
//!
//! # Absolute-time baseline
//! Segment deadlines are computed relative to a task's own release time
//! (the papers' `r_i,j`, Section 4.2), but this experimental setup admits
//! every DAG-Fluid task once at boot, before dispatch
//! (`finish_create_dags`) begins — there is no live "job release" event
//! yet to anchor to. [`register_segment`]'s caller-supplied `release`
//! time stands in for it (by convention, `Time::now()` at admission —
//! see `rd_gen_to_dags::build_dag`'s `dagfluid` arm); this is a
//! documented approximation, not the papers' own semantics.
