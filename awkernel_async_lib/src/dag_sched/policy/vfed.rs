//! V-Fed ("virtually-federated") admission policy (Jiang, Guan, Liang, Tang,
//! Qiao, Wang — RTSS 2021 / TPDS 2023) for **constrained-deadline**
//! (`D <= T`) DAG tasks.
//!
//! Where classical Federated ([`super::federated`]) grants a heavy DAG
//! exclusive ownership of whole physical cores (wasting whatever capacity
//! the DAG doesn't use on them), V-Fed constructs, on each physical core, an
//! **active-VP** (a budget-limited virtual processor the owning DAG uses
//! with the highest priority) and a complementary **passive-VP** (the
//! leftover capacity, offered to some other task at low priority). A heavy
//! DAG still gets the same minimum core count as classical Federated
//! (`m = ceil((C-L)/(D-L))`, see [`crate::dag_sched::metrics::DagMetrics::min_dedicated_cores`]),
//! but when there are not enough free cores for a full active-VP group, the
//! shortfall can be topped up with *other* DAGs' leftover passive-VPs
//! instead of failing admission outright — and light DAGs (`C <= D`) can be
//! served entirely from passive-VPs, with no dedicated core at all.
//!
//! # Scope of this module (current state)
//!
//! The batch path ([`admit_batch`]/[`is_batch_feasible`], both built on
//! [`plan_batch`]) follows the TPDS 2023 version's Algorithm 2
//! (`Allo_Both`) and Algorithm 1 (`AllocH`) line by line:
//! - [`sbf`]: the supply bound function (Lemma 1).
//! - [`PassiveTest`]: Theorem 2 / condition (12) (passive-VPs only,
//!   `C <= L + Σ max{H_j - L, 0}`) and Theorem 4 / condition (13) (active
//!   plus passive, `C <= Σθ + Σ max{H_j - L, 0}`), kept as two distinct
//!   conditions -- an earlier revision folded Theorem 2 into Theorem 4 with
//!   `Σθ = 0`, silently dropping Theorem 2's `L_i` term.
//! - [`pi_star_supply`]/[`pi_prime_supply`]: the passive-VP term of both
//!   conditions on the hypothetical platforms `Π*` (OURS1) and `Π'`
//!   (OURS2, only when an owner's maximum parallelism is known), accepted
//!   "with either" as Algorithm 1 lines 17/25 say. `Π'` replaces an owner's
//!   sbf values only when *all* passive-VPs complementary to its
//!   active-VPs are in the same `Π` (Sec. 4.2, p. 38).
//! - [`try_alloc_heavy_within`]: Algorithm 1 as written, including the
//!   partial-group branch (lines 10-17, run once, on whatever processors
//!   remain -- possibly none) and the `goto line 19` switch to Theorem 2
//!   for every heavy DAG after it.
//! - [`search_min_heavy_cores`]: Algorithm 2's search over `M_h`.
//! - [`plan_batch`]: Algorithm 2's light-task handling -- passive-VPs by
//!   Theorem 2 first, then `Partition(L, M_l)` as best-fit partitioned EDF
//!   with the DBF* test of the paper's reference \[15\] (see
//!   [`crate::dag_sched::partition`]).
//!
//! Numbering: this module cites the TPDS 2023 version. The RTSS 2021
//! version covers heavy tasks only, with the same analysis under other
//! numbers -- Lemma 3 = Lemma 1 (sbf), Theorem 1 conditions (4)-(6) =
//! (8)-(10), Theorem 2 condition (8) = (12), Theorem 3 condition (10) =
//! (13), usefulness condition (17) = (18), Lemma 6 = Lemma 9 -- and a
//! single Algorithm 1 that equals `AllocH(m)`: no `M_h` search, no light
//! tasks, no `Π'` (OURS2). See `vfed/paper_examples.rs`.
//!
//! [`admit_one`] is an incremental, one-DAG-at-a-time variant kept for
//! callers that admit DAGs individually. It uses the same theorems but is
//! *not* the paper's algorithm (no global sort, no `M_h` search, and a
//! density-based partition test, since DBF* needs deadline-ordered
//! insertion); the kernel's V-Fed build uses [`admit_batch`].
//!
//! The scheduler mechanism itself now exists too —
//! [`crate::scheduler::active_vp`] (budget-gated active-VP dispatch,
//! leading-VP preference), [`crate::scheduler::passive_vp`] ("yield while
//! the owner is busy" passive-VP dispatch), and
//! [`crate::scheduler::mixed_vp`] (Theorem 4's combined role: a single task
//! dispatched on both its own active-VP cores and other DAGs' borrowed
//! passive-VP cores, whichever becomes eligible first) — and
//! [`VFedAssignment::into_scheduler_type`] connects an admission decision to
//! whichever of the three applies, plus the partitioned-EDF fallback for a
//! light DAG that fits no available passive-VP.
