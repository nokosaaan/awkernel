//! V-Fed's active-VP scheduler ([`crate::dag_sched::policy::vfed`]): the
//! highest-priority tier, one exclusive slot per core in a heavy DAG's
//! active-VP group. Reuses [`super::clustered_edf`]'s cpu_set-restricted
//! affinity queue and `invoke_preemption` pattern verbatim for the actual
//! dispatch/migration/preemption mechanics (an active-VP group behaves
//! exactly like a `ClusteredEDF` cluster there — greedy, work-conserving,
//! preemption and migration freely allowed among the group's own cores),
//! and adds two things `ClusteredEDF` does not need:
//!
//! - A strict preference for the group's *leading* core (the paper's rule:
//!   a non-leading core may only take active-VP work while the leading
//!   core is busy). Enforced entirely on the *pop* side, in
//!   [`ActiveVpScheduler::get_next`] — not by restricting which cpu_set an
//!   entry is *pushed* with, which cannot correctly express "leading may
//!   still be idle when a second vertex becomes eligible while leading is
//!   already serving a first one". Both a task's own `wake_task` and every
//!   core's `get_next` hold `GLOBAL_WAKE_GET_MUTEX`, so `get_next`'s check
//!   of "is my group's leading core currently running something" is
//!   race-free.
//! - A replenishable per-job execution budget per core that forces the
//!   served task off a core once exhausted (see [`tick_budget`]), freeing
//!   that core for a complementary passive-VP (`super::passive_vp`, not
//!   yet implemented — see that module's doc for why this scheduler alone
//!   does not yet complete V-Fed's mechanism).
//!
//! # WCET contract (tick path: [`tick_budget`], [`mark_idle`])
//! - No heap allocation.
//! - No blocking, no `.await`.
//! - Bounded: O(1) per call (fixed-size per-cpu array access only).
//! - Never panics for any `cpu_id < NUM_MAX_CPU` (the only caller,
//!   [`crate::scheduler::wake_task`]'s per-cpu loop, already bounds it that
//!   way); out-of-range ids are rejected via `.get()`, not indexed.
//! - Does not log, format, or call user code.
