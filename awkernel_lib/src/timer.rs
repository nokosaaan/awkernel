// net against a lost edge-triggered interrupt). A second, independent

// just call `reset`/`arm_at` directly -- it would stomp on whatever
// `awkernel_lib::cpu::sleep_cpu_no_std`'s own idle-wakeup deadline had
// armed, since both would be fighting over the same single register block.
//
// This multiplexer merges every registered consumer's own "please wake me
// at time X" request per core into one soonest-wins arm of the physical
// timer, and re-arms for whatever remains every time it fires.
